What are good indicators of a user who will likely purchase again? What about indicators of users who are likely NOT to purchase again? If you had more data, what features would you want to look into to answer this question?
    - The best indicators for a user who would like to purchase again would be number of orders already made. This could be used for users who are not likely to purchase as well if perhaps they only bought one inexpensive product. Perhaps long delivery times / deliveries that were not completed could be an indication as well of users who are not likely to purchase.
